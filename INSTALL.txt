Installation instructions for diffpy.srmise

Linux, Unix, and Mac
====================
Given a downloaded source distribution, simply expand the file and run
setup.py install

Other installation options are possible via easy_install (part of the
setuptools package) or pip.  These are available at the given URLs.
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

In addition, pip may be quickly installed by running the following
bootstrap script.
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Installation from a downloaded source distribution is then
easy_install diffpy.srmise-version.tar.gz
or
pip install diffpy.srmise-version.tar.gz

More powerfully, these allow installation from the PyPI package database.
easy_install diffpy.srmise
or
pip install diffpy.srmise

See the documentation for easy_install or pip for additional options.

Installation on Windows
=======================
Although diffpy.srmise is pure Python, its dependencies are not. Windows
users are strongly encouraged to install an appropriate binary distribution
 for NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib before installing diffpy.srmise.
NumPy - http://www.numpy.org/
SciPy - http://www.scipy.org/
matplotlib - http://www.matplotlib.org/

Unfortunately, a Windows binary of diffpy.pdfgui compatible with diffpy.srmise
is not available. Fortunately, diffpy.srmise relies only on Python components
of diffpy.pdfgui, so even an incomplete installation is sufficient.  Simply\
attempt to install diffpy.pdfgui from source or PyPI.  Even though elements
will fail to compile, the Python sources should still be copied to your
Python installation's site-packages directory and therefore be available to
diffpy.srmise.

It is also possible to compile a Windows version of diffpy.pdfgui.  The
instructions below assume you have installed Python from Windows binaries,
and that the Windows Path environment variable gives access to python.exe and
Python scripts.  (This is the default for most Windows installations of
Python.)
1) Install an appropriate wxpython binary.
   http://www.wxpython.org
2) Install Visual Studio Express 2008.

3) Download VSE 2008 compatible port of GNU Scientific Library (GSL) by David
   Geldreich.
   http://david.geldreich.free.fr/dev.html
4) Build GSL headers and libraries in VSE 2008.  (See the documentation for the
   VSE 2008 compatible GSL project.)  Make sure this is not a debug build, and
   note the directory where these are created.
5) Copy the Windows ports of getopt.h, stdint.h, and unistd.h to some
   directory the compiler will check.  It may be simplest to create a new
   directory with these three files and temporarily add it to the Windows
   $PATH.  This step is necessary to compile diffpy.pdfgui's PyCifRW
   dependency.
6) Open a command window.  (This may need to be an elevated window on some
   systems.)
7) In the command window, set environment variable CL.
   SET CL=/I"gsl_include_directory"
   where "gsl_include_directory" is the directory with the header files.
   For example, if error.h is located at C:\mypath\include\gsl\error.h, then
   "gsl_include_directory" is "C:\mypath\include".
8) In the command window, set environment variable LINK.
   SET LINK=/LIBPATH:"gsl_lib_directory"
   where gsl_lib_directory is the directory containing the GSL library you
   built.  This file must be named "gsl.lib" if it is not already.
9) Install diffpy.pdfgui within this command window.  Using easy_install or
   pip is highly recommended since they will automatically compile and link
   everything else that is needed. Thus,
   easy_install diffpy.pdfgui
   or
   pip install diffpy.pdfgui
10) Install diffpy.srmise as outlined at start of the document.

At the time of writing using non-Microsoft compilers (such as gcc with MinGW)
is not successful due to naming conflicts in libraries from the other
binaries.  If you compiled Python for Windows yourself, use the same compiler
for diffpy.srmise's dependencies.
